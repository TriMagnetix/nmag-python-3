# Refined NMesh OCaml to Python 3 Migration Plan (V3 - Comprehensive Engineering & Management)

This plan details the migration of the `nmesh` library from a hybrid Python 2 / OCaml implementation to a pure Python 3 implementation, combining technical depth with clear work packages and acceptance criteria.

## 1. Objectives
- **Pure Python 3:** Eliminate the OCaml dependency and the `ocaml` Python module.
- **NumPy-First Architecture:** Mandate NumPy as the foundation for all internal data storage and linear algebra.
- **Performance Parity:** Use vectorization and optimized libraries (`scipy`, `numba`) to ensure performance parity with OCaml.
- **Public API Stability:** Keep the user-facing `nmesh` API stable unless an intentional public API break is explicitly approved.
- **Modular Design:** Split the monolithic `nmesh.py` into maintainable sub-modules.
- **Incremental Verification:** Mandate unit tests for every module to ensure parity with the legacy implementation.
- **Code Quality:** Maintain readable, maintainable code following complexity guidelines.

### Modernization Rule
- Internal contracts are allowed to change when it improves clarity, maintainability, or performance.
- This includes file/module boundaries, private helper functions, internal callback payloads/signatures, and internal data flow.
- Public API behavior is the compatibility boundary; internal compatibility is not required.
- Any intentional public API break must be documented and covered by updated tests.

### Dependency Rule
- Required runtime dependencies must be treated as mandatory and imported directly.
- Do not add optional-import fallbacks, `try/except ImportError` shims, or degraded execution paths for core packages such as `numpy`, `scipy`, `meshio`, `h5py`, `numba`, or `pymetis`.
- If a package is required for a feature or module, installation/configuration must ensure it is present before the program is run.

### Typing And Documentation Rule
- New and migrated Python modules must include explicit type hints for public functions, methods, and non-trivial internal helpers.
- New and migrated classes, public methods, and non-obvious helper functions must include concise docstrings describing purpose, inputs, and outputs when the behavior is not self-evident from the signature alone.
- Migration work is not complete for a module until the implementation, tests, type hints, and baseline docstrings are all in place together.

### Code Complexity Rule
To ensure maintainability and readability, all migrated code must follow these complexity guidelines:

**Function Length:**
- Target: Functions should be <50 lines
- Hard limit: Functions >80 lines require explicit justification and should be refactored unless performance-critical (e.g., JIT kernels)
- Guideline: 90%+ of functions should be under 50 lines

**Cyclomatic Complexity:**
- Target: <10 branches per function (if/for/while/elif/try/except)
- Hard limit: Functions with >15 branches must be refactored
- Use helper functions to decompose complex logic

**Nesting Depth:**
- Target: <3 levels of nesting
- Hard limit: 4 levels maximum
- Deep nesting signals need for extraction or early returns

**Single Responsibility:**
- Each function should have one clear purpose
- If a function does multiple distinct things, extract helpers
- Function names should clearly describe their single responsibility

**File Size:**
- Target: <500 lines per module
- Files >500 lines should be evaluated for splitting into sub-modules
- Exception: Test files may be longer

**Rationale:** These limits are based on software engineering research showing that complexity beyond these thresholds correlates with increased defect rates and maintenance difficulty. The Python 3 migration is an opportunity to improve upon the original OCaml codebase's structure.

### Numerical Robustness Rule
- Pure-Python ports may replace exact floating-point equality checks from the OCaml implementation with small documented tolerances when this improves numerical robustness.
- Small bounded tolerances are also acceptable in boundary-projection and convergence-control code when needed to avoid jitter or false non-convergence near surfaces.
- These divergences must be intentional, documented inline, and covered by regression tests when they affect meshing behavior.

### Low-Risk Extraction Rule
- Prefer extracting low-coupling pieces from `nmesh.py` early, before the full meshing engine port is complete.
- Good early candidates include pure data models, thin data containers, file-format serializers/parsers, standalone helper functions, and narrowly scoped geometry/CSG wrappers.
- Examples include `RawMesh`, ASCII mesh read/write helpers such as `write_mesh`, file-type detection helpers, and small mesh-construction utilities that do not own meshing-engine state.
- Keep the public `nmesh` import surface stable during these moves by re-exporting migrated symbols from `nmesh/__init__.py`.
- Use these extractions to shrink the monolith first, create clearer test seams, and reduce risk before tackling the core meshing engine and relaxation loop.

## 2. Proposed Module Structure (`nmesh/` directory)

    3. Port timing/memory reporting equivalent for `time_vmem_rss`.
- **Acceptance:**
    1. Utility tests pass with deterministic inputs in `tests/nmesh/test_utils.py`.
    2. Numerical helpers match OCaml reference outputs within `1e-9` tolerance.

    4. Migrate `nmesh.py` symbols that directly belong to mesher configuration and driver setup.
       This includes `get_default_meshing_parameters` and the callback/mesher-configuration portion of `Mesh.__init__`, but does not include file I/O helpers such as `write_mesh`.
- **Acceptance:**
    1. Setter-based tests reproduce expected overrides in `tests/nmesh/test_defaults.py`.
    2. Callback interval tests verify invocation cadence and the current callback contract.

    1. Port primitive boundary-condition builders: `bc_box`, `bc_ellipsoid`, `bc_frustum`, `bc_helix`.
    2. Transition to NumPy-compatible Signed Distance Functions (SDFs).
    3. Implement affine transform logic (`shift`, `scale`, `rotate`) using matrix multiplication.
    4. Implement CSG operations: `union`, `difference`, `intersection`.
    5. Extract geometry-facing `nmesh.py` symbols into `nmesh.geometry` modules.
       This includes `MeshObject`, `Box`, `Ellipsoid`, `Conic`, `Helix`, and the `union` / `difference` / `intersect` helpers.

    3. Port periodic point bookkeeping and index mapping.
    4. Port **Iterative Relaxation Loop**:
        - Shape, Volume, Neighbor, and Irrelevant Element force calculations.
        - JIT-optimized smoothing loop using `numba`.
        - Insertion/Deletion of points (Voronoi/Delaunay criteria).
- **Acceptance:**
    1. Deterministic meshing succeeds with fixed RNG seeds in `tests/nmesh/test_integration.py`.
    2. Periodic and hint-driven scenarios complete with valid topology.

### Section 5: Query & Extraction APIs (Porting `mesh.ml`)

       This includes `MeshBase`, cached property accessors, `outer_corners`, `to_lists`, and `tolists`.
- **Acceptance:**
    1. Accessor tests pass for populated meshes and edge cases.
    2. Cache tests validate stale-data invalidation when nodes are scaled.

### Section 6: I/O & Constructors (Porting `lib1.py`)
**Goal:** Complete pure-Python constructor and file I/O parity.
- **Work Packages:**
    1. Port ASCII `# PYFEM` reader/writer rules.
       This includes extracting disconnected legacy helpers such as `write_mesh` and file-type detection into `nmesh.io.ascii` as an early, low-risk step.
    2. Implement `MeshFromFile`, `load`, `save` without OCaml backend.
    3. Implement HDF5 compatibility via `h5py` for all core datasets.
    4. Migrate constructor and serialization helpers that are independent of the core relaxation engine.
       This includes `_is_nmesh_ascii_file`, `_is_nmesh_hdf5_file`, `hdf5_mesh_get_permutation`, `MeshFromFile`, `load`, `save`, `_raw_mesh_as_legacy_write_data`, and `write_mesh`.
    5. Keep simple mesh-construction utilities grouped with constructor work when they primarily exist to build `RawMesh` instances rather than to run the meshing engine.
       This includes `mesh_from_points_and_simplices`, `generate_1d_mesh_components`, and `generate_1d_mesh`.
- **Acceptance:**
    1. ASCII and HDF5 round-trip tests preserve topology and metadata in `tests/nmesh/test_io.py`.

## 5. Performance Strategy
1. **Vectorization:** Avoid Python loops for force calculations; use NumPy broadcasting.
2. **JIT Compilation:** Apply `@numba.njit` to the relaxation loop and hot math functions.
3. **Sparse Structures:** Use `scipy.sparse` for large connectivity matrices.

| `Qhull.delaunay` | `scipy.spatial.Delaunay` |
| `determinant` | `numpy.linalg.det` |
| `Mt19937` | `numpy.random.Generator(PCG64)` |
| `Metis` / `Parmetis` | `pymetis.part_mesh` |
